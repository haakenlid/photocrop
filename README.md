# React photo cropping widget

React photo cropper with svg controls.

![what it looks like][example]

Used for parametric image cropping with multiple / unknown output image size.

## Demo

## Tests

nope

## Known issues

Uses the [pointer events] api, which is supported by most browsers, but not
Safari. So it requires [pointer events polyfill] to work on apple devices.

Also uses some svg and css features that might not be fully supported by all
browsers. With the PEP polyfill, I think it should work in Chrome and Firefox on
most platforms.
